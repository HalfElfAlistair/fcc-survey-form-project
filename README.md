## Introduction

Made as part of the Responsive Web Design course on FreeCodeCamp.

### Course Aim

Meet the 16 user stories in [the brief](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form).

- User Story 1: I can see a title with id="title" in H1 sized text.

- User Story 2: I can see a short explanation with id="description" in P sized text.

- User Story 3: I can see a form with id="survey-form".

- User Story 4: Inside the form element, I am required to enter my name in a field with id="name".

- User Story 5: Inside the form element, I am required to enter an email in a field with id="email".

- User Story 6: If I enter an email that is not formatted correctly, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

- User Story 7: Inside the form, I can enter a number in a field with id="number".

- User Story 8: If I enter non-numbers in the number input, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

- User Story 9: If I enter numbers outside the range of the number input, which are defined by the min and max attributes, I will see an HTML5 validation error.

- User Story 10: For the name, email, and number input fields inside the form I can see corresponding labels that describe the purpose of each field with the following ids: id="name-label", id="email-label", and id="number-label".

- User Story 11: For the name, email, and number input fields, I can see placeholder text that gives me a description or instructions for each field.

- User Story 12: Inside the form element, I can select an option from a dropdown that has a corresponding id="dropdown".

- User Story 13: Inside the form element, I can select a field from one or more groups of radio buttons. Each group should be grouped using the name attribute.

- User Story 14: Inside the form element, I can select several fields from a series of checkboxes, each of which must have a value attribute.

- User Story 15: Inside the form element, I am presented with a textarea at the end for additional comments.

- User Story 16: Inside the form element, I am presented with a button with id="submit" to submit all my inputs.


### Personal Aims

Create a form that works responsively and meets what I know of UI best practice.


## Technologies

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Launch

Running this project locally should be nice and easy! Either download the repository from Github or use the viewer on Codepen.

### Prerequisites

None

### Running

Once you've downloaded and unzipped the repo file, simply open up the index.html in your browser.


## Built With

- Visual Studio Code

- Chrome Devtools

- codepen.io/FCC: Test Suite Template

I used VSC and Chrome Devtools to compile my code. Then copied the <body> and CSS into the codepen test suite.

## Author Notes

I didn't go overboard with the CSS here by any means. I figure simplicity and functionality are more important with a survey form. That said, I'm not convinced by the aesthetic so may go back and make some changes to this at a later date. I've seen a few other examples of this project where people set an image background, which could work nicely.

The pirate theme was resumed for this project, I'm rather enjoying that one.
